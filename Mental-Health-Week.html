				<h1>What is Mental Health Week?</h1>
				<p>Mental Health Week is part of a national mental health promotion campaign held in October each year, and incorporates World Mental Health Day, held globally on 10 October. The purpose of this awareness week is to engage communities in activities that promote mental health and wellbeing and also increase understanding and reduce stigma about mental illness, and how it impacts on the lives of people in our community.</p>
